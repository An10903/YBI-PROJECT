# Election Analysis



## Overview of Project

YBI Python Project

## Summary

The analysis os the election show that:

Using Python and reading in the CSV election data set we determined out of the 369,711 votes some patterns and analysis.


### Resources

- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Client requirements
- Software: Python 3.7.7, Visual Studio Code, 1.47.3, Git 2.27



#### Learned with the tools

- Navigating to folders on your computer using the command line.
- Reading and extracting data from CSV files.
- Determining the difference between Python data types, like integers, floating-point decimal numbers, and strings.
- Performing mathematical operations using data types.
- Declaring variables using different data types.
- Creating and using data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- Creating and using decision and repetition statements.
- Creating and using Boolean and logical operators.
- Writing data to an output file and print the file.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

While learning Python, reviewing the code, building a sound script for analysis you could miss some creative ways to look at the data.
